# phi4-Critical-Casimir-Force
Data of Monte Carlo simulations of the Critical Casimir Force in 3D O(N)-models

# What is the data?

We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of a classical $\phi^4$-type lattice model, to the end of extracting the Casimir force. The details can be found in the accompanying [Masters thesis](Masters_Thesis_Jonas_Wattendorff_422461.pdf).

## In short:
We simulated a cuboidal lattice of size $L_z \times L_{yx} \times L_{yx}$ with a variety of boundary conditions. The aspect ratio is $\rho = L_z / L_{yx}$ and various values of $L_z$ were used for finite-size scaling analyses. We use two
